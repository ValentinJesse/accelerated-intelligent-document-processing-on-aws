 * Which fields can be shown on the page, and why the rest cannot.
 *
 * Requested as [#1327]: the viewer offered a locate control on some rows and
 * nothing on the others, with no statement of the rule and no count, so a reader
 * could not tell whether the missing boxes were a limitation of their
 * configuration or a fault.
 *
 * The shape here is the one a real run produces. In a ten-field form section from
 * a packet processed under the default `ocr_only` mode, six fields carried a value
 * and a box and four carried neither — so "has a box" and "has a value" coincided
 * exactly. The fixture reproduces that split rather than the document, whose text
 * does not belong in this repository.
